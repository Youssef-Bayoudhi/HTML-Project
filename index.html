    <p>In 2022, I obtained my bachelor's certificate and embarked on a journey into Science Economics at ESSECT in 2023.<br><br> However, I soon realized my true calling lay in technology and decided to pivot towards becoming a Fullstack Developer.
      <br>
      <br>
      During my journey, I gained valuable experience in customer service at a library and served as Communication and Marketing Responsible for an event in 2023.<br><br>These roles honed my interpersonal skills and taught me the importance of effective communication in achieving organizational goals.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am currently studying diligently to acquire the skills necessary for Fullstack Development, combining my love for technology with a knack for problem-solving.<br><br> My portfolio reflects my dedication to learning and showcases projects that demonstrate my proficiency in :<br><br> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and other technologies essential for modern web development. <br></p>
